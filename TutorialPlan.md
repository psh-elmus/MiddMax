MIDI Effects

MIDI Monitor (display pitch/velocity)  
MIDI Interval (knobs/sliders/numbers), play transposition interval  

Generating notes (added note by interval)  
Generating notes (qlists)  
Processing with math  
Control by phone  

Audio Effect  

Distortion/Filter  
Loop  
Pitch Shift  
Vocoder  
Harmonizer  

MIDI Instrument   
Granular Synthesis  

Other plans:  
A sample "guitar pedal" that non-programmers can use as a demo/model. Perhaps looping, distortion, chorus versions?  

A demo using the MakeyMakey just to show an example of Makers. (I own an Arduino, but the Makey Makey is simpler to use, so I thought that'd make a better demo.) I plan to show this to the class Tuesday.
