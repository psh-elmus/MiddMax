Hi, Fiona, ILl start communicating on Github now instead of e-mail.

For my local Git, I'm trying both Git Bash (the terminal version) and Get Desktop (the more modern interface). The terminal is easy to use but seems unnecessarily retro. (I know I won't remember the commands and command sequences if I'm away from it for a bit.) On the other hand, the terminal is straightforward, and I actually haven't gotten the Desktop version to work, so there's that!

Anyway, let me know your experience with them. 


Hi, it's 3:30 -- new thing.
