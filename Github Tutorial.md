Just for myself, I'm trying to summarize how to best use git tools for this project  

Github -- General organization, text document editing  
Local repository -- best place to add Max patches  
Git Desktop -- For me, the easiest way to do basic repository management/pull/commit/sync operations.  
Git GUI -- nice way locally to see branches and their contents  

I downloaded Atom, not sure of its utility for this project. I've been using Brackets and Wordpad for local text editing.
