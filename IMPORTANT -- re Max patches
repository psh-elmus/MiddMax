You don't need to copy the patch as text and then enter it into a text file on git. All you have to do is drag the Max patch into the git folder, and, of course, commit it. It will be added as a binary file to the repository. 

The file itself is text anyway, although we won't be editing it directly. I never realized that Max patches were text. I thought they were binary files that were converted to text. Learn something every day!
