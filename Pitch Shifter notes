There are some artifacts -- I want to check if there's a way to improve quality. Perhaps not. The artifacts are most noticeable when the pitch is changed continuously, so maybe the solution is to only allow set steps? But also see if there are pfft/gizmo settings that can improve this.

Also -- I'd like to find a way to get keyboard input. Perhaps through midiinfo?
